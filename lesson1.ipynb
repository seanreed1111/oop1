    "Motivation: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was/is/was seen as the best thing since sliced bread up until about 20 years or so ago. As computing problems have gotten more and more complex, there have been waves of developers who have pushed back, preferring a style called 'functional' programming. Since OOP has much more momentum, particularly in Python , it is a must for serious students of Python programming to understand in detail how it works.\n",
